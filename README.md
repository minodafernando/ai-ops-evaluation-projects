# ü§ñ AI Operations Evaluation Projects

This repository contains two mini case studies inspired by the Analyst, AI Operations role at Clio. Both projects simulate real-world tasks an AI Ops Analyst might perform ‚Äî from evaluating the quality of chatbot responses to optimizing GenAI prompt design for clarity, tone, and accuracy.

These projects combine structured evaluation methods, correlation analysis, and visual reporting to explore how AI tools can be improved in customer-facing environments ‚Äî particularly in legal tech, where precision and readability must be balanced.

## üìÅ Projects

### 1. [AI Chat Evaluation: A Case Study in Customer Support Optimization](./project-1_ai-chat-eval)
Analyzed the quality of 15 AI-generated customer support responses across three key dimensions: accuracy, tone, and helpfulness. This project involved:
- Manually scoring responses using a custom rubric
- Identifying trends by response category (billing, account, support)
- Uncovering tone-related weaknesses in high-friction scenarios
- Recommending improvements for AI tone handling and escalation logic

### 2. [Prompt Engineering Audit: A Case Study in AI Response Optimization](./project-2_prompt-audit)
Evaluated how different prompt styles (Direct, Formal, Friendly) affect the quality of GenAI-generated responses to legal support questions. This case study:
- Tested 3 prompt styles across 3 real-world legal questions
- Scored responses based on accuracy, clarity, and tone
- Found strong correlation between tone and clarity, and a tradeoff between accuracy and readability
- Offered prompt design recommendations to improve GenAI performance in customer support
